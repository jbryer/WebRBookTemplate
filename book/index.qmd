# Introduction

This Github repository contains both an R package and a Quarto book site. The goal is:

* Implement Shiny applications within an R package along with supporting functions.
* Build the package to be used with `shinylive.`
* Build a Quarto book site that embeds the Shiny applications within the book.

The advantage of this approach is that Shiny applications can: 1. Be run directly from the R package installed in any R session; 2. Embedded within websites using `shinylive`; and/or 3. Hosted on a traditional Shiny server.


This example uses the Shiny application embedded within the R package.

```{shinylive-r}
#| standalone: true
#| viewerHeight: 500
webr::install("WebRBookTemplate", repos = c("https://jbryer.github.io/WebRBookTemplate/", "https://repo.r-wasm.org/"))
library(WebRBookTemplate)
library(shiny)
shiny::shinyApp(ui = WebRBookTemplate::loess_shiny_ui,
				server = WebRBookTemplate::loess_shiny_server)
```
